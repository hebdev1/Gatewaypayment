These don't block "complete for all merchant types" but make HaitiPay
competitive long term:

- **Crypto** (USDC on Solana / Stellar)
- **Cash collection** at retail points
- **BNPL** / installment plans
- **Multi-currency** auto-conversion (USD / EUR / DOP)
- **Cross-border remittances** (diaspora → HT)
- **Reseller program** for agencies
- **White-label** version of the dashboard

## Quarterly progress goals

| Date | Milestone |
|---|---|
| **2026-07-14** | First 10 real merchants on live mode |
| **2026-08-11** | NatCash + clean SDK + payouts |
| **2026-09-22** | Subscriptions + WooCommerce + invoicing |
| **2026-11-17** | Cards + Apple/Google Pay + marketplaces |
| **2026-12-15** | Public launch ready |

Total: **~6 months** of focused work to reach a complete platform.

## Effort breakdown (rough)

- Phase 1 (hardening + self-service): ~17 dev-days
- Phase 2 (NatCash + SDK + payouts): ~15 dev-days
- Phase 3 (subs + invoices + plugins): ~24 dev-days
- Phase 4 (cards + marketplace + fraud): ~32 dev-days
- Phase 5 (polish + scale): ~13 dev-days
- **Total: ~100 dev-days** (~5 person-months at 100% focus)

A single-developer pace (50% focus, no weekends, occasional firefights)
realistically lands the full plan in **6 months**. A 2-developer team
can compress to **3 months**.
